               (ANZICS) Registry run by the Centre for Outcomes and Resources
               Evaluation (CORE) turns 30 years old. It began with the Adult
               Patient Database, the Australian and New Zealand Paediatric
               Intensive Care Registry, and the Critical Care Resources
               Registry, and it now includes Central Line Associated
               Bloodstream Infections Registry, the Extra-Corporeal Membrane
               Oxygenation Database, and the Critical Health Resources
               Information System. The ANZICS Registry provides comparative
               case-mix reports, risk-adjusted clinical outcomes, process
               measures, and quality of care indicators to over 200 intensive
               care units describing more than 200 000 adult and paediatric
               admissions annually. The ANZICS CORE outlier management program
               has been a major contributor to the improved patient outcomes
               and provided significant cost savings to the healthcare sector.
               Over 200 peer-reviewed papers have been published using ANZICS
               Registry data. The ANZICS Registry was a vital source of
               information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Upcoming developments
               include reporting of long-term survival and patient-reported
               outcome and experience measures.",
